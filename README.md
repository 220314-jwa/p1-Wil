# Java with Automation Foundations Project

For this project, I created a full-stack application.

## Technology Used
JDBC, AWS, Javalin, PostgreSql, Dbeaver, Cucumber, Selenium, Javascript, Bootstrap

## About the Application
The following is the application I created.  

### SPMS: Story Pitch Management System

Story Pitch Management System is an application which allows authors to submit pitches for stories to the publishing company. They can write a small description of the story they hope to write, and editors can go into the application and approve or reject story pitches based on whether they sound interesting or even suggest changes before approval.

## Technical Requirements

1. I stored and retrieved from a PostgreSQL database (local or AWS).
2. I accessed data in Java using JDBC DAOs.
3. I used postman to test my end points 
4. I used Javalin to handle HTTP requests and responses. 
5. I tested different service layers using JUnit and Mockito.
6. I tested my DAOs using JUnit.
7. I wrote my front-end using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and Bootstrap.
8. I tested my login using Selenium.
